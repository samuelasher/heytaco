In terms of finding content, I also think that teaching people on how to search is important, 3 out of the 4 people i mentored arent english speakers natively, and for each of these  mentorship I covered several times how to approach searching for cards. In how this is addressed, I am not sure if there is a non-english panel kinda giving feedback or how we go about improving tags or adding synonyms for cards. But I guess this is a puzzle for you to solve! :)','In the context of a more international team, it would be good to have more sandbox tickets asking how things work, rather than how to fix an issue to ensure new hires have the understanding as well as the wording around teaching someone about these topics.
I also strongly believe that visuals will help people with different English level get a picture of how it works without being fully relying on English verbal/written explanation','Killer work! Love the improvements happening as well as the cross team efforts with Quality!! üëç'
